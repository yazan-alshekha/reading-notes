## layout

1. `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

2. Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

3. The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

4. Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

5. Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

6. Grids help create professional and flexible designs

7. CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks

8. You can include multiple CSS files in one page
