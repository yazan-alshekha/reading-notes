## HTML 

**Bold Tag**

By enclosing words in the tags `<b>` and `</b>` we can make characters appear bold.

**ADD Break to line**
put that tag where you want  to add the new line '<br>'

**add a horizontal rule between sections**
add `<hr>` tag to add horizontal solid line 





## CSS
The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
```
p { color:red;}
```
- This rule indicates that all `<p>` elements should be shown in the Arial typeface. 

- **Selectors** indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas

- **Declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.

## JavaScript

**creating variable**
Examples of creating variable
```
var a=5.6; //numeric data type
var b='yazan';//string data type
var c='true'; //boolean data type
```

**example of creating arrays**
```
var color=['blue','green','red'];
```

*you can change value of specific place by use something call (index)*

```
var color=['blue','green','red'];
color[0]='pink' // here will change value of index 0 to new value 
```

2. Functions
 Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
 specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
 reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
  + Declarin a function
   ```
   function sayhello(){
   document.write('hello');
   }
   ```
  + Calling a function
   ```
   sayhello();
   ```
