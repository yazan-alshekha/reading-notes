## Image

+ The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page.

+ You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

+ You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

+ Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

#### Rules for creating images

There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website which are summarized below. We go into greater detail on each topic over the next nine pages.

1. Save images in the right format

Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. If you choose the wrong image format then your image might not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load.

2. Save images at the right size
 
You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website. If the image is smaller than the width or height that you have specified, the image can be distorted and stretched. If the image is larger than the width and height if you have specified, the image will take longer to display on the page.

3. Use the correct resolution

Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels. Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. Resolution refers to the number of dots per inch, and most computer screens only show web pages at 72 pixels per inch. So saving images at a higher resolution results in images that are larger than necessary and take longer to download.

RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
