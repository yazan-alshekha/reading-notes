## Functions
 Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
 specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
 reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
  + Declarin a function
   ```
   function sayhello(){
   document.write('hello');
   }
   ```
  + Calling a function
   ```
   sayhello();
   ```
