# Document Object Modual


 

## The browser represents the page using a DOM tree. 

## DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 

## You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

## Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nade list.

## From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

## An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.  


## n older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery). 

## Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree

**to get element by it's name** 

```
